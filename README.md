# Geog458Lab2

For the lab I chose to compare the tweets coming from the United States to those coming from Europe. I decided to do this to see if there was any noticable differences between the two areas. 

A difference that I found in the maps was that it was clear that twitter in the United States was much more active. This makes sense as when I captured the tweets at around 7 pm Pacific time, meaning it was 10 pm East coast time and very early in the morning for Europe.

The most interesting difference in the word clouds that I noticed was that the tweets from the United States were heavily focused on the NBA playoffs, speciffically the Boston Celtics vs the Brooklyn Nets. There were key words highlighted such as "Net", "Celtic", "Brooklyn","Win", "Shot", and "Tatum" (As in Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics).
